THIS IS A VERY OUTDATED REPO
email w.stott at engineeredarts.co.uk if you desire access.

Deceptive name:
Quick hack to export a (very limited) SDF in an automatic manner.

Added:
* Simple GUI
* SDF support
*      Prismatic, and Revolute joints only.
*      Mesh colliders and visuals only.
* STL export

Lots of stuff from original URDF converter left, it's a little messy in there.

To build, just open the .sln with Visual Studio, and click run or build.
